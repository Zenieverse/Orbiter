ORBITER PRIME: A Platform for Encrypted Solana Applications

ORBITER PRIME is a conceptual, high-impact platform that utilizes Arcium's Secure Compute Environment (SCE) to bring unparalleled privacy and integrity to decentralized applications built on Solana. By outsourcing sensitive computation (like matching orders or dealing game hands) to a private, encrypted layer, ORBITER PRIME ensures that critical information remains hidden from all external parties, including validators and sequencers.

The Core Mission: Zero-Trust Privacy

The fundamental purpose of ORBITER PRIME is to solve the problem of information asymmetry and front-running that plagues public blockchain environments.

Challenge Solved

ORBITER PRIME Solution (via Arcium)

Impact

MEV/Front-Running

Encrypted Matching Engine (EME). Orders are matched on ciphertext, preventing observation.

Eliminates value extraction by sequencers and bots.

Cheating in Games

Secure Game State Management. Private hands/decks are cryptographically hidden.

Guarantees verifiable fairness in hidden-information games.

Data Leakage

Confidential Compute. Price, quantity, and game state are processed using FHE/MPC.

Ensures end-to-end user privacy for sensitive parameters.

Key Pillars of the Platform

ORBITER PRIME is demonstrated through two primary application pillars, showcasing the versatility of Arcium's encrypted layer:

1. Encrypted Dark Pool (Finance)

This pillar focuses on creating a completely private trading venue that eliminates market manipulation derived from order book visibility.

Encrypted Matching Engine (EME): The core mechanism where traders submit limit orders that are encrypted client-side. Arcium's SCE receives the ciphertext and performs the matching logic against the encrypted order book.

MEV Prevention: Since the price and size of pending orders are never revealed, front-running is made impossible. Only the final, executed trade result is returned to the public Solana ledger for immediate, immutable settlement.

Zero-Knowledge Order Book: Users gain the benefit of guaranteed execution privacy without relying on any centralized, trusted party.

2. Encrypted Poker Engine (Hidden-Information Games)

This pillar applies encrypted compute to solve the trust problem inherent in competitive games requiring hidden state.

Secure Game State: The entire deck, player private hands, and the order of community cards are encrypted and stored within Arcium's SCE at the start of the game.

Verifiable Draw Logic: When it is time to reveal the Flop, Turn, or River, the Solana smart contract requests Arcium to execute the "draw" function on the encrypted state. Arcium securely calculates which cards to reveal, decrypts only those cards, and provides a new, updated hash of the remaining encrypted state back to Solana.

Zero-Trust Fairness: This process guarantees that cards are drawn correctly from the sealed deck and that no one—not the players, the host, nor the blockchain—can peek at the remaining private information, making the game provably fair.

Technical Integration Summary

ORBITER PRIME relies on the Arcium architecture to operate functions that require data secrecy:

Client Encryption: Data is encrypted locally (simulated via mock FHE/MPC functions in the client app).

Solana Integration: Solana serves as the Level 1 Settlement Layer, managing user accounts and recording the final, verified results (settled trades or revealed cards).

Arcium Compute: Arcium acts as the Level 2 Confidential Compute Layer, running complex, data-sensitive functions like order matching and card drawing on the encrypted data payload. The security guarantee is provided by Arcium's cryptographic integrity proofs.
The ORBITER Gateway Execution Console is a simulated application designed to showcase the power and efficiency of integrating with the Sanctum Gateway API. It allows users to execute high-value, time-sensitive atomic swaps with two major guarantees: Guaranteed Confirmation Speed and Zero-Loss Reversion.

This application simulates a system that utilizes a dual-path broadcast strategy, commonly used for maximizing transaction speed on Solana while minimizing cost risk.

✨ Key Features & Value Proposition

1. Atomic Profit Guarantee (Zero-Loss)

Users set a Minimum Required Profit Target. The transaction is engineered with an on-chain profit check. If the market conditions change just before execution, and the profit target is not met, the entire transaction atomically reverts without affecting user funds. The final cost paid is 0 SOL.

2. Speed-Guaranteed, Cost-Conditional Delivery

The application simultaneously broadcasts the atomic swap through two channels:

High-Priority Channel: A costly Jito Bundle with a user-defined high tip (e.g., 0.025 SOL) for maximum speed certainty.

Low-Cost Channel: A standard, near-free Custom RPC path.

The Sanctum Gateway tracks the race. If the cheaper RPC path wins, the high Jito tip is automatically refunded to the user. This ensures the user gets the speed of the high tip with the cost of the low tip, achieving the best possible outcome.

3. Real-Time Audit Log

Provides a detailed, time-stamped trace of the entire execution lifecycle, including:

Simulated network latency.

Confirmation of the winning path (RPC or Jito).

Explicit confirmation of the conditional tip refund.
