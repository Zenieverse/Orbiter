# Orbiter
The ORBITER Gateway Execution Console is a simulated application designed to showcase the power and efficiency of integrating with the Sanctum Gateway API. It allows users to execute high-value, time-sensitive atomic swaps with two major guarantees: Guaranteed Confirmation Speed and Zero-Loss Reversion.

This application simulates a system that utilizes a dual-path broadcast strategy, commonly used for maximizing transaction speed on Solana while minimizing cost risk.

âœ¨ Key Features & Value Proposition

1. Atomic Profit Guarantee (Zero-Loss)

Users set a Minimum Required Profit Target. The transaction is engineered with an on-chain profit check. If the market conditions change just before execution, and the profit target is not met, the entire transaction atomically reverts without affecting user funds. The final cost paid is 0 SOL.

2. Speed-Guaranteed, Cost-Conditional Delivery

The application simultaneously broadcasts the atomic swap through two channels:

High-Priority Channel: A costly Jito Bundle with a user-defined high tip (e.g., 0.025 SOL) for maximum speed certainty.

Low-Cost Channel: A standard, near-free Custom RPC path.

The Sanctum Gateway tracks the race. If the cheaper RPC path wins, the high Jito tip is automatically refunded to the user. This ensures the user gets the speed of the high tip with the cost of the low tip, achieving the best possible outcome.

3. Real-Time Audit Log

Provides a detailed, time-stamped trace of the entire execution lifecycle, including:

Simulated network latency.

Confirmation of the winning path (RPC or Jito).

Explicit confirmation of the conditional tip refund.
